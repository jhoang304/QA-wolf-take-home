The reason why I want to work at QA Wolf is that I believe Quality Assurance is essential in software development and it's actually more interesting to me to look for bugs and try to re-create them.
Having to make sure that there are no problems in the software feels reassuring and makes it feel like that nothing could break it. I would feel great if I knew that the software was thoroughly tested
and protected against multiple failure cases. Working with a start-up also gives me a sense of companionship within the company because I love creating connections with everyone in the company, it makes
me feel like I'm working with friends which is something I value tremendously. I also think that working as a QA Engineer will help evolve my debugging skills and grow in the software development field.
This may come as a surprise but I also like to work with customers as I'm able to listen to any comments or concerns they have when it comes to software testing. Addressing their feedback and concerns
directly contributes to the softwareâ€™s enhancement and cultivates a respectful and constructive customer service experience. I just want to say thank you for this opportunity, I would really love to
work in this kind of environment and I hope I am an ideal fit for the company.
